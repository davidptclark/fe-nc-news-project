## 💭 Description

This website is my front-end project that uses [my news API](https://github.com/davidptclark/be-nc-news) built in the back-end phase of the Northcoders bootcamp.

- 🚦 Filter articles by topic
- 📑 Sort articles by: date, comment count and votes
- ⬆️⬇️ List sorted articles in ascending or descending order
- 📄 View a single article
- 🧵 View comments relating to a given article
