# 🗞️ My News Aggregator App 🗞️

Hello! 👋 Welcome to my news aggregator app - NC News.

## 💭 Description

This is my front-end project that uses [my news API](https://github.com/davidptclark/be-nc-news) built in the back-end phase of the Northcoders bootcamp.

## 🤔 What Does It Do?

Making calls to the API, the app allows the user the following functionality:

- 🗞️ Access a list of all articles
- 🚦 Filter articles by topic
- 📑 Sort articles by: date, comment count and votes
- ⬆️⬇️ List sorted articles in ascending or descending order
- 📄 View a single article
- 🧵 View comments relating to a given article
- 💬 Post comments
- 🗑️ Delete user comment
